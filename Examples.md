- `startBeat`: The beat to start the effect on.
- `endBeat`: The beat to end the effect on.
- `speed`: The speed in how many times it bounces before reaching the player.
- `maxY`: The max Y level the note can reach on negative Y and positive Y
- `easing `:The easing to use.
- `transparent`: Should only the arrow be visible?
 
 **Ghosty Track**:<br />
 Apply's the Ghosty effect to a track.<br />
 This will override any animations already applied to the notes.
 
-  `track`: The track to apply the effect to.
- `speed`: The speed in how many times it bounces before reaching the player.
- `maxY`: The max Y level the note can reach on negative Y and positive Y
- `easing`: The easing type.
- `transparent`: Should only the arrow be visible?

Example:
```ts
import { Difficulty } from "https://deno.land/x/remapper@3.1.1/src/mod.ts"
import * as nootils from './nootils/index.ts'
